	    Six piles, deal card face up in first pile.  Place one
	    card face down on all other piles.  Place one card face up
	    on the first two piles then one card face down on all covered
	    piles.  Place three cards face up and the rest face down and so on.  
	    Repeat gradually revealing more cards each time until there are 
            six rows with six cards.  
	    Tableau can be built down in alternating colors.  Groups of
	    cards can be moved.  Empty piles can only be filled by Kings
	    or group of cards starting with a King.

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Aunt Mary is extremely difficult and rarely solvable.  
    The real challenge is not finishing but seeing how far you can get.
