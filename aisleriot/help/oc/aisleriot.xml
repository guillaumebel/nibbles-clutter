<application>AisleRiot</application> (also known as Solitaire or sol) is a collection of card games
which are easy to play with the aid of a mouse. The rules for the games have
been coded for your pleasure in the GNOME scripting language (Scheme).

 <title>Playing <application>AisleRiot</application></title>

 <para>
  Use the mouse to move cards. Click a card and drag it somewhere.
  Release the mouse button to deposit the card.
 </para>
 <para>
  Alternatively, you can move a card by clicking once to pick it up and clicking again to place it. To enable this way of moving cards, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Control</guimenu><guimenuitem>Click to move</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This can be faster than dragging and
  will be easier on your hand since you don't have to hold the mouse
  down. However, it may take a while to get used to.
 </para>
 <para>
  If a card can be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to
  drag it. You can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence
  of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally move
  the sequence as one move.
 </para>
 <para>
  Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation, if that is
  possible. This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at
  the end of a successful game.
 </para>
 <para>
  In games which have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on
  the empty space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you
  do this a limited number of time. Watch for the <guilabel>Redeals Left</guilabel> message
  at the bottom of the window.
 </para>
 <para>
  A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card
  which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise
  it so that you can see what it is.
 </para>
 <para>
  Some games have options to change the way the game is played. For
  example Klondike can be played with either single card deals or
  three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu with the
  game's name. You can only change the rules of the game at the
  beginning of the game - the menu will be inactive during the game.
 </para>
 <para>
  Statistics on how well you have done at a particular game are
  available by selecting <guimenuitem>Statistics</guimenuitem> from
  the <guimenu>Game</guimenu> menu. Only games where you actually
  start moving cards are counted. The statistics are here for your own
  enjoyment, there are numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to
  make comparisons.

			Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven. Deal cards face up
            one per space. The spaces should be considered as one continuous line, the rows 
            simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once. Thus the 
            rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space
            of the row below.

  <para>
    Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank
    that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left.
    The card that is covered is removed from play. All the cards (if any) in spaces to the 
    right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap.
    Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces, if possible, or failing that one space 
    to the left.

  <para>
    This is a diffcult game. Try to find two or three cards of the same rank at or near the

    onto each other to win.

    Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no
  moves are available (or you just feel like it), click on the empty top
  left slot for a redeal.
  </para>
  <para>
    Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each
  other in order, starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply
  turned over and redealt, four cards at a time, back to the tableau. If no
  moves are made, redealing will not alter the arrangement of the
  cards. Therefore, the game is lost if no move is possible immediately
  after a redeal.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note: a degenerate case occurs whenever, after a redeal, the last
  tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from
  the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only
  results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if
  this situation is detected.

    There is no reason to have an empty slot when dealing another batch
    of cards.  However, when you have an empty slot, try to keep it
    empty as long as possible, as this is a great way to get rid of
    buried cards.

    If any two cards dealt on to the Tableau are the same suit and in
    sequence, place the lower card on to the higher. Aces are low,
    Kings are high and sequence does not wrap.  Click on the Stock
    to fill in the empty slots that are made.

  <para>
    When no plays can be made in the Tableau, click on the Stock to
    deal a card on to the Waste. If this card can be played on to any
    of the Tableau piles, do so. Repeat this process until there are no
    more moves in the Tableau or from the Waste.
  </para>

    At this point, clicking on the Foundation again moves all the cards
    in the Tableau back to the bottom of the Stock.  The card in the
    Waste is put in the first Tableau pile and the rest of the Tableau
    is filled with one card to each pile from the Stock.

				A 52 card poker deck. There are four suits of thirteen cards each.  Each
				suit contains an Ace, 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King.  These suits
				are usually Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds.  These suits can be
				grouped into two colors, usually black and red.  The Clubs and the
