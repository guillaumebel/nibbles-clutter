This is Free Software and there are no restrictions on your use and
enjoyment of it. In most countries copyright law would prevent you
from sharing these programs, either as is or in a modified
form. However we provide a license to allow you to modify and
redistribute this code. This is the GNU General Public License and it
can be found in the file COPYING. This allows you to do almost
anything you would like with this software, including selling
it. There are only two catches, firstly you can't restrict anyone else
from copying the code, you have to give them the same freedoms you
received (including access to the source code). Secondly, because the
code may have been modified and we have no idea what state it will be
in when it reaches you, we cannot provide a warranty. All the details
can be found in the file COPYING which should have accompanied this
software. If it didn't you can find a copy at

# TODO
=========================
This installer is currently in beta status. It's tested right now only on
a clean WindowsXP(SP2).
Using it in the current status is on your own risk! No one besides you will 
be responsible if any harm happens to your pc when using this beta installer!
If you have installed guile and setup an environment path, the installer will
overwrite it with the installation path set by the installer. Uninstall will
remove the complete guile environment path.

all item in this list can be discussed - so if you have any suggestions and
ideas for further updates regarding the installer, feel free to contact me.

- make multiple installs (full, selective, ...)
- different installers (development installer, complete, games-only)
- check wether gtk2+ is installed or not
- check wether guile is installed or not
- additional start menu entries (web links, etc.)
- update uninstaller to leave no traces on the system (right now install folder remains)
- implement correct license file
- use "modern UI"



# Maintainers
=========================
The current maintainer for gnome-games Windows installer is:

Tom Bass <tom.bass@gmx.net>  

While you can email them with suggestions and bug reports it is better
to use either the bug tracking system (see below) or the mailing
list. Even for suggestions the bug tracking system is better because
it ensures that there is an archive of the discussion and it is harder
for the maintainer to loose suggestions. For more general discussion,
policy issues and issues that many people will be interested in, the
mailing list is the best place.
