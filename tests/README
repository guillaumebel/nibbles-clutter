Unit testing for gnome-games using Check
----------------------------------------

gnome-games uses Check 0.9.5 for unit testing.

http://check.sourceforge.net/

Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple interface
for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. 
Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both assertion
failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals. 
The output from unit tests can be used within source code editors and IDEs.

Here are two goals for unit testing in gnome-games:

- The first goal would be adding tests checking known bugs. If you detect a 
bug and don't want it to be regressed you can add a test to know if 
it happens again.

- The second goal is trying to run as many code paths as you can, in order
to be sure they behave as expected, and don't segfault.


Todo list for unit testing in gnome-games:
------------------------------------------

* Displaying test coverage using lcov is planned, but not implemented yet.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltp/

* glChess and Gnome Sudoku are implemented in Python,
and could use PyUnit as an unit testing framework.
http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/

* Write more tests for each of the games. 

* New unit tests for new bugs to prevent regression.
