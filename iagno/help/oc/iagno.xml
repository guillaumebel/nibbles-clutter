      <para>
	Iagno is the two player strategy game of Othello, which is also known as
	Reversi and is similar to Go. The pieces are tiles that are black on one 
	side and white on the other and the objective is for the player to flip 
	his/her opponent's tiles to his/her color, while keeping the opponent 
	from doing the same. Once the board is filled with tiles, the winner is 
	the player with the most of his/her color tiles on the board.

  <title>What is Iagno?</title>
  
  <para>
  <application>Iagno</application> is a computer version of 
  the game Reversi, more popularly called Othello.  
  <application>Iagno</application> is a two player strategy 
  game similar to Go.  The board is 8 by 8 with tiles that 
  are black on one side and white on the other side.  The 
  object of <application>Iagno</application> is to flip as 
  many of your opponent's tiles to your color as possible 
  without your opponent flipping your tiles.  This is done 
  by trapping your opponent's tiles between two tiles of 
  your own color.
  </para>

  <para>
    Iagno also features <link linkend="network-games">multiplayer</link> support with two 
    human players in hotseat or network mode.
  </para>

  <para>
   To run <application>Iagno</application>, select
   <guimenuitem>Iagno</guimenuitem> from the
   <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
   Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>iagno</command> on the
   command line. 
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="why">
  <title>Why is Othello called Iagno?</title>
  <para>
  You're probably wondering why this game is called
  <application>Iagno</application> instead of Othello or
  even gnothello.  The answer is complicated, and involves
  things like trademarks and lawyers and whatnot.
  Instead of leaving 
  it at that, I'll tell you a long and complicated lie about 
  the origin of the name <application>Iagno</application>.
  </para>
  <para>
  On a stormy night, like those depicted so much in England, 
  a lonely programmer was sitting in front of his computer 
  screen.  Ian had finished his masterpiece in gaming.  It 
  was a fully interactive game of Othello and he decided
  to play a pun with the name and called it gnothello for 
  the game was written using GNOME.  
  </para>
  <para>
  Later his buddies came over and like all programmers he 
  showed off his masterpiece.  They all laughed in his face 
  and told Ian that his game was worthless and a pitiful 
  attempt to be a true hacker.  After Ian kicked them out 
  he decided to rename his program Iago 
  <footnote>
   <para>
   Iago is Othello's nemesis in the play <citetitle>Othello
   </citetitle> by William Shakespeare.
   </para>
  </footnote>
  for the evil which 
  had manifested itself due to his game.  Yet it still 
  didn't sound right.  All GNOME programs have some part 
  of GNOME in it, Ian thought.  After much thought he decided 
  on the name we have come to cherish, <application>Iagno
  </application>.
  </para>

 <title>Playing Iagno</title>
 <para>
 The board starts with four tiles arranged in a box on the 
 middle of the board. The tiles have the same color at each 
 corner, as shown in <xref linkend="start-shot"/>.

 <para>
 Black goes first and places a tile on the board such that it 
 traps white's tiles between two of black's tiles. When black places 
 a tile on the board all of white's tiles between black's newly placed 
 tile and another black tile, in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, are flipped over 
 and become black, as shown in <xref linkend="first-shot"/>.

 <para>
 When there is tile trapped between two tiles, of an identical color 
 in the same row, the player captures tiles until another tile of the 
 player's color is encountered, as shown in <xref linkend="block-shot"/>.  
 The player can only take tiles that are 
 a direct result of the placing a tile on the board. Once a tile is 
 placed on the board the player cannot remove it and place the tile 
 somewhere else. If a player cannot move they forfeit their turn.  
 The game ends when it is no longer possible for either player to move.

 <figure id="block-shot">
  <title>White cannot capture the black tile in the center of the
  middle column because there are white tiles blocking the ends of that
  column. If it where blacks turn instead, black could place a tile at
  the top of the column but would only flip the first of the two white
  tiles.</title>

  When you start Iagno the human player plays black and the computer player 
  plays white with the first level of difficulty. Using the
  <guimenuitem>Game</guimenuitem> tab in the
  <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> dialog you can set the type of
  player for each color. Human is of course you, level one is the
  easiest computer player and level three is the hardest. You can set
  both to human to play against a friend or set both to computer to
  watch the computer play itself.

  makes the computer player place its tiles faster.

  This option controls the amount of animation present when each tile is 
  flipped, using radio buttons.  Selecting the option <guibutton>none

  Selecting the <guibutton>option</guibutton> partial will cause the 
  animation to flip the tiles slowly.  Selecting the <guibutton>complete
  </guibutton> option will cause the tiles to flip slowly and smoothly.

 <sect2 id="stagger-flips">
  <title>Stagger Flips</title>
  
  <para>
  This option causes captured tiles along a row, column, or diagonal to
  flip one after another, like dominoes, instead of all flipping
  simultaneously.  It has no effect on game play, but looks cool.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="grid">
  <title>Show Grid</title>

  <para>
  This option will display a grid on top of the playing surface.  The

  This option moves all the black tiles to the top of the board and all the

  you to visually see the outcome of the game.

  tile set that works with Iagno send it to Ian Peters <email>itp@gnu.org</email> 
  and he will include it with the next distribution.

<title>Waiting for other players to join the game</title>
<para>
Once you have successfully joined a game table, then you have to wait until enough
players have joined the table. The <guimenuitem>Players List</guimenuitem> menu item
allows you to see a list of the players who have joined the game.

<title>Playing multiplayer Iagno games</title>
<para>
Multiplayer Iagno games have pretty much the same rules as normal Iagno games,
except that you are now playing against human players. This means that other
strategies might possibly be better than when playing against AI players.
</para>
<para>
Once a player has won, the game ends and you can return to the initial network game screen.
Then you can play yet another game of addictive Iagno multiplayer!
