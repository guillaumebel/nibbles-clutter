      Iagno is the two player strategy game of Othello, which is also known as Reversi and is similar to Go. The pieces are tiles that are black on one side and white on the other and the objective is for the player to flip his or her opponent's tiles to his or her colour, while keeping the opponent from doing the same. Once the board is filled with tiles, the winner is the player with the most of his or her colour tiles on the board.
