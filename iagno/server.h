/* REVERSI PROTOCOL VERSION 0.0.5
 *
 * The server handles everything, from the AI to the validity of moves
 *
 * RVR_STATE_INIT:
 *
 * First, it fetchs from the ggz_server how much seats there are, and how much are open/closed
 *
 * RVR_STATE_JOIN:
 *
 * Then, it waits until some player join . When he does, it sends:
 *
 * To Joining player:
 * 	RVR_MSG_SEAT (int)SEAT_NUM
 * To All Human players:
 * 	RVR_MSG_PLAYERS PLAYER_IDENTIFER[BLACK] PLAYER_IDENTIFIER[WHITE]
 *  where PLAYER_IDENTIFIER is:
 *  	(int)PLAYER_TYPE
 *  	if PLAYER_TYPE == GGZ_SEAT_OPEN
 *  		(str)PLAYER_NAME
 *
 * If the game was already happening, send the current game state to the new player
 *
 * 	RVR_MSG_SYNC (char)TURN BOARD_STATE
 * 	where TURN is the current turn, and:
 * 		BOARD_STATE = (char)POSITION * 64
 *
 * When all the open seats are filled, it enters playing state (state = RVR_STATE_PLAYING) and sends:
 *
 * To All Human players:
 * 	RVR_MSG_START
 *
 * RVR_STATE_PLAYING:
 *
 * If current player is AI:
 *
 * 	doMove(AI_MOVE());
 *
 * If it isn't AI, then it waits until client sends a RVR_REQ_MOVE
 *
 * When client sends a RVR_REQ_MOVE, the server must check if he is the current player and
 * if the move is valid. (The client should do it too, must the server must recheck to avoid cheating)
 * Then the server executes the move, and sends:
 * 
 * To All Human players:
 *
 *	RVR_MSG_MOVE (int)MOVE
 * 	where MOVE can be a array index (0-63) or one of the following error values:
 * 		RVR_ERROR_WRONGTURN
 * 			The player tried to move when it wasn't his turn
 * 		RVR_ERROR_INVALIDMOVE
 * 			The player tried a invalid move (Cheating sign!)
 * 		RVR_ERROR_CANTMOVE
 * 			The player can't move (no possible move)
 *
 * Then the server checks if the game is over (No more valid moves) and who has won. If the game is over,
 * it sends to All Human players:
 *
 * 	RVR_MSG_GAMEOVER (int)WINNER
 * 		where WINNER can be: BLACK, WHITE, EMPTY(draw)
 *
 * If some player left while the game was happening, it sends to all Human players:
 *
 * 	RVR_MSG_PLAYERS
 *
 * And it will wait until someone returns
 *
 * Any time, the server can receive a RVR_REQ_SYNC message from the client.
 *  If this is the case, it sents a RVR_MSG_SYNC to this player.
 *
 * The client (more information should be avaiable on the client's game.h file):
 * 
 * The client waits until a RVR_MSG_SEAT is sent to him, indicating what is his seat.
 * Then it waits until a RVR_MSG_PLAYERS, with the type/name of all the players
 * Then it waits until a RVR_MSG_START is sent.
 *
 * If a RVR_MSG_SYNC message is sent to him, it replaces the current game state with the one sent.
 * 
 * Then he enters playing mode.
 *
 * If it is his turn, The user selects a valid square and the client sends:
 * 	RVR_REQ_MOVE (int)MOVE
 * Then it waits until the server sends:
 * 	RVR_MSG_MOVE (int)MOVE
 * If move >= 0, do the move. Else, tell the player what was the error.
 * 
 * If it isn't his turn, it waits until the server sents a
 * 	RVR_MSG_MOVE (int)MOVE
 * If move >= 0, do the move. Else, tell (if necessary) what was the error.
 * 
 * After the move is done, change to the other turn.	
 *
 * If anyone has left the table, it will receive a RVR_MSG_PLAYERS from the server. Then it enters waiting mode again.
 *
 * When the game is over, it sends a RVR_MSG_GAMEOVER (int)winner to the players, and enters DONE state. If it receives enough RVR_REQ_AGAIN msgs, it sends a RVR_MSG_START to the players.
 *
 * Luckily that's all, this protocol is perfect and it shouldn't be modified anymore. Or so I hope. :) */
