	* games-conf.c: (games_conf_constructor), (games_conf_finalize),
	(games_conf_get_double), (games_conf_set_double): Fix compilation on
	maemo where g_key_file_[sg]et_double isn't available (since it's glib
	>= 2.12 only). No code change on !maemo.

2007-09-10  Thomas H.P. Andersen <phomes@gmail.com>

	* games-conf.c: games_conf_get_integer_with_default should not always return default value.

        Landed the AisleRiot refactoring from my GIT branch at
        http://www.gnome.org/~chpe/git/gnome-games.git/

        Overview of the changes for libgames-support:

        * Refactored code
        * Improve SVG rendering time for supported themes
          (right now only Bellot theme)
        * Support pre-rendered themes with one file per card per size per theme
        * Decrease memory used for theme caching by only caching the pixmaps or
          pixbufs, not both
        * Improved antialiased card rendering quality

        Bugs fixed includes the following:
        * SVG card set takes too long to load (Bug #337080)

        You can access the full changelog in the svn history.

2007-05-18  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

2007-05-18  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in:
	* Makefile.am: Remove libgnomegames.schemas.in since it is unused.

2007-05-18  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* games-sound.c: Play sounds in a separate thread.

2007-03-20  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* bonded.svg: XLink URI that should read "w3.org" instead of "w3org",
	patch from Evert Verhellen in bug #414426. 

2007-02-10  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* games-clock.c: 0 is the correct value of an invalid timeout.
	Patch from Christian Persch in Bug #405063. 

2007-02-03  Andreas Rsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* games-files.h
	* games-controls.h

	* games-gridframe.c
	* games-files.c
	* games-controls.c: Patch from Christian Persch <chpe@gnome.org>, in Bug #403660. 
	The cleanup consists of the following bugfixes and cleanups:

	Bug fixes:
	- finalize and dipose MUST chain up to the parent classes handler [everywhere]
	- int/uint confusion: gconf handler IDs are unsigned [games-controls.c]
	- leaks reference returned by gconf_client_get_default () [games-controls.c]
	- fix typecast macros to return the right types [games-card-selector.h,
	games-card-pixmaps.h]

	Cleanups:
	- use G_DEFINE_TYPE
	- combine 2 gboolean's into a bitfield (saves 4 bytes per instance) [games-card-images.h] 
	- remove useless games_controls_list_finalize handler and do all the work in
	dispose [games-controls-list.c]


2006-12-23  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@openshine.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_get_license): Updated FSF snail mail address.

2006-12-03  Andreas Rsdal  <andrearo@pvv.ntnu.no>

	* games-dlg-chat.c: ggz multiply defined on darwin,
	patch by Paul in Bug #381812.

2006-11-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.c (games_scores_dialog_finalize): Add an
	explicit finalize function to avoid memory leaks.

2006-09-05  Andreas Rsdal  <andrearo@pvv.ntnu.no>

	* Makefile.am:
	* paris.svg: Deprecated and moved to gnome-games-extra-data.

2006-10-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove gob support.

2006-10-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog-private.h: 
	* games-scores-dialog.h: 
	* games-scores-dialog.c:
	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Start disassociating ourselves from
	gob. It was useful for bootstrapping, but when the object matures
	it is just as easy to have it in C (and it's more hackable).

2006-09-25  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat.com>

	Bug #347262.
	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_new_from_file): Cast srcbuffer
	pointer to char* first.
	* games-files.c (games_file_list_find): Removed incorrect cast.

2006-09-05  Andreas Rsdal  <andrearo@pvv.ntnu.no>

2006-06-11  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-scores-backend.c: Truncate the file after writing over old
	content. (#344548)
	* games-setgid-io.[ch]: Support file truncation.

2006-05-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-files.c: 
	* games-card-images.c: Patch from Amnon Aaronsohn to fix up the
	card loading for the case where no cards are found.

2006-04-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-find-file.c: 
	* games-find-file.h:
	* games-card-images.c: Remove the fallback parameter from
	games_find_similar_file since it doesn't look like it will be
	useful in practise. Put guard macros in games-find-file.h.

2006-04-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* Makefile.am: Make the bonded card theme an SVG theme rather than
	a PNG one. Add games-find-file.* to the build.

	* games-card-images.c (games_card_images_prerender): Make the
	fall-back code use the games_find_similar_file function.

	* games-find-file.c: 
	* games-find-file.h: New code to find a "similar" file in a given
	path.

	* games-files.c: Add a new function: games_file_list_find. It is
	analogous to g_list_find_custom. Make the first argument of
	games_file_list_new const.

	* games-files.h: Fix up the file name in the leading comment.

2006-04-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-card-images.c: Add some instrumentation code.

	* games-preimage.c: Gain a factor of 2 in start-up time by using
	gdk_pixbuf_get_file_info instead of a more-or-less-copy of it that
	got broken by gdk-pixbuf changes.

2006-03-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Fix a comment typo.

2006-03-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Prevent multiple attempts to set the
	hilight;

2006-03-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-card-images.h: Swap the hearts and diamond enum entries to
	match the image files. See bug #335078 where it was finally
	noticed by Sander Marechal who actually wanted to use those values.

2006-03-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-network-dialog.c:
	* games-network.c:
	* Makefile.am: Avahi support courtesy of Daniel Haischt. See bug
	#331649.

2006-03-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Try and set editable after the window
	is fully up so that the editing subwindow appears on the right
	place. This is a bit of a hack.

2006-02-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-network-dialog.c (connect_cb): server -> lan_server when
	we are using a local server. Daniel Haischt spotted this one.

2006-02-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Fixes to allow NULL categories to work
	as desired. This includes adding a dummy category for use when we
	want an anonymous category. Should fix bug #331613.

2006-02-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-setgid-io.c: #include <stdlib.h> for exit ()

2006-02-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: Remove the default "" category in favour of a
	NULL category. Sprinkle warnings around to make sure we do the
	right thing. This should fix bug #330401. The alternative of
	deliberately ignoring a "" category was rejected on the grounds
	that it would take more code and wasn't going to give warnings
	about buggy code on the client end.

2006-02-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-network-dialog.c (network_game_dialog_show):
	Identification label wasn't being translated. Spotted by Funda
	Wang (bug #329972).

2006-01-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-controls.c (games_controls_list_add_control): Simplify the
	schema-reading code and make it more robust. We get the entry
	directly from the GConfClient now.

2006-01-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Make sure only the new row in the high
	scores dialog is editable.

2006-01-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Allow the name to be set when a high
	score has been set. This should qualify for fixing bug #315442.

	* games-scores.h: 
	* games-scores.c: Add games_scores_update_score as a hack to let
	us set the name after the fact. i.e. out of the
	games_scores_dialog. While it is a public interface, no one should
	use it without very good reasons.

	* games-score.c:
	* games-score.h: Add games_score_compare_values to compare a pair
	of GamesScoreValue types. games_score_compare is now implemented
	in terms of it.

2006-01-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Make the code set the correct column
	headers based on style, i.e. say "Time" instead of "Score" when
	the score is a time. The code was already there, just not wired in
	properly.

2005-12-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-files.c: Start adding standard documentation comments to
	the files. Functions only for now.

	* games-files.h: Annotate games_file_list_new* with
	G_GNUC_NULL_TERMINATED.

	* games-setgid-io.c: Clarify the design and security risks in the
	comments at the top of the file.

2005-12-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-setgid-io.c:
	* games-setgid-io.h:
	* games-scores-backend.c: Add a separate process to remain setgid
	while the rest of the program runs unprivileged.

2005-11-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-scores-backend.c:
	* games-scores-backend.h: Fix a deadlock where a call to
	games_scores_get was obtaining a lock on the scores file that
	didn't go away until the game was over. It stopped two games
	running simultaneously.

2005-10-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* Makefile.am (libgames_support_la_SOURCES): Remove the obsolete
	rteleport.h and teleport.h from the distribution.

2005-10-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-network-dialog.c (network_game_dialog_show): Don't use
	hard line-breaks in strings (bug #318940).

2005-10-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-backend.c: Make writing and reading the high score
	information locale independent.
	(games_scores_backend_get_lock): When obtaining the file lock on
	something we already have the lock on, rewind the file to the
	beginning.

2005-09-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Fixes for some of the warnings brought
	up by --enable-build-breaker.

2005-09-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-backend.c: Make sure that the object only has one
	open file descriptor at a time. i.e. we aren't "relocking" the
	file if calls to _get_lock are nested.

2005-09-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Bug fixing for the hilighting.

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-scores.h: Add an add_category method and use it
	internally. This reduces code duplication and makes games with
	category lists that aren't hard-coded possible.

2005-09-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

        * games-scores-backend.c: Implement file locking and rewrite the I/O
	routines to use a object-wide file descriptor.
	
	* games-scores-backend.c: Check whether the scores file has
	changed and update the list if it has.

	* games-scores.c: Add an ordered list of the categories and make
	the foreach iterator use it. This means we can fix the dialog's
	combo box ordering problem while retaining the hash for random
	lookups.

2005-09-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: Move GamesScorePrivate definition out of the
	public header. Add support for an empty category list.

2005-09-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-network.c: 
	* games-network-dialog.c:
	* games-network.h: Change game_server -> games_network_server_name
	to try and get around naming conflicts. See bug #315473.

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Hide the catbar when there is only one
	category (this is fixing a regression in the new code). Also mark
	as private public functions that are now unnecessary.

	* games-scores.c (games_scores_get_current): Pass the backend the
	rather than the name to generate the filename.

2005-09-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-backend.c (games_scores_backend_get_scores): Fix
	the ordering of the created scores list.

	* games-scores.c: Cut the overflow off correctly.

2005-09-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-scores-backend.c: Finally! The scores file gets written
	out. Still lots of issues, but the system is at least functional.

2005-09-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-scores.h:
	* games-scores-backend.c:
	* games-scores-backend.h:
	* games-scores-dialog.gob: More work on the scoring system. The
	insert-score logic is good, although it still doesn't write to
	file. The generic logic was also moved from games-scores-backend
	to games-scores.

2005-08-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@lspooky-possum.org>

	* games-score.c: 	
	* games-score.h: Reintroduce the scalar score as
	GamesScoreValue. Also fill out the name and time fields of a
	GamesScore in the _new function.

2005-08-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob:
	* games-scores.c:
	* games-scores.h: Further movement towards a working
	implementation. Added _get_style and _get_category to games-scores
	to support games-scores-dialog. Categories are now set correctly
	(although still not ordered correctly, we may need to move away
	from a hash table). The formatting for adding a score is also
	correct, but no actual file I/O occurs.

2005-08-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* games-scores.h: 
	* games-scores.c: Remove the _show method and make this a 
	pure glib object. In other words, don't try and encapsulate
	dialog . Let the dialog be a view of this data instead.
	Add a _get method to export the list of high scores and clean
	up the _add_score method.

2005-08-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.c:
	* games-scores.h: Yet more work towards functioning
	code. Implemented a private version of GamesScoresCategory that
	stores the backend and generates it on demand.

	* games-network.h: 
	* games-network.c:
	* games-network-dialog.c:
	* Makefile.am: Patch from Hans Petter Jansson to allow Bonjour to
	be used for zeroconf networking instead of Howl. Also ensures that
	all the Howl specific code is confined to games-network.[ch].

2005-08-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-backend.c (games_scores_backend_get_list): Fill out
	the list.

	* games-score.c: 
	* games-score.h: Expand the structure to include date and name
	fields. Move the old GamesScore into a union inside the
	struct. Add a games_score_destroy function.

2005-08-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-backend.c (games_scores_backend_get_list): Added
	a proper parser for the old-style score files. It still doesn't
	pass anything to the caller, it looks like we have to extend
	GamesScore.

2005-08-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (%.c %.h %-private.h): Reinstate the gob rule. I had
	been disabled for diagnostic reasons and not reinstated.

2005-07-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-stock.h:
	* games-stock.c: Add support for local icons in the icon theme.

2005-07-29  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* games-scores-dialog.c: (games_scores_dialog_set_message):  
	Add mnemonic to new game button.
	
2005-07-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-controls.c: gconf_engine_* calls don't handle a NULL
	engine argument so we have to explicitly check for errors at each
	stage. FIxes bug #300423.

2005-07-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.c: 
	* games-network-dialog.c: 
	* games-network.c: Fixed for gcc 4.0 warnings. Note the extra NULL
	in the gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons because gcc believes that
	first_button_text is mandatory.

2005-07-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-server.py: Make it become a proper Unix daemon. This
	should fix bug #172171.

2005-07-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c (network_game_dialog_show): Change the
	initial status message to be a little less clunky.

2005-07-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: players -> player's. Spotted by Clytie
	Siddall.

2005-07-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Insert the correct file list for the
	schemas. Add schema_DATA to DISTCLEANFILES. This should fix a
	"make distcheck" problem.

2005-07-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.[c|h]: Fix for warnings related to buffer signedness.

2005-07-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am
	* games-scores.c:
	* games-scores.h:
	* games-score.c:
	* games-score.h:
	* games-scores-backend.c:
	* games-scores-backend.h:
	* games-scores.gob: Ditch gob for games-scores*, create pure C
	versions of everything. It even compiles now. Nothing useful
	happens though.

2005-07-07  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-scores.[c|h]:
	* games-scores-private.h: Add to CVS. These are from a prior
	games-scores.gob
	* Makefile.am: Try to skip doing anything the the games-scores.gob
	temporarily.

2005-06-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.gob: I'm stuck in Changi Airport and I can only
	find the brain-power to clean up warnings.

	* Makefile.am (GOB_FILES): Rearrange the names so the dependencies
	work out right.

2005-06-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.gob: The first games-scores code. It doesn't work
	yet, but it does compile. DO NOT USE, it was just simpler to fix
	an accident by uploading it.

	* games-network.c (games_host_lan_game): Patch from Sven Herzberg
	to replace snprintf with g_strdup_printf.

2005-06-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Added the GPL at the top of the file.

2005-06-23  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_new_from_file): Ensure that the
	pixbuf loader is closed prior to setting our rendering path. 

2005-06-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c: Massive UI reorganisation. The
	preferences have now been folded into the main window. As a
	side-effect this fixes the bug where you had to visit the
	preferences window before "Connect" would do anything. The status
	text box has been reduced to a single line that indicates what we
	are trying to do right now. Errors should appear as dialogs (I
	haven't fixed everything coming from the non-GUI side yet). Don't
	mistake this for the last word in GUI design either - it is merely
	better, not good.

2005-05-31  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_prepare_for_statusbar_tooltips) 
	(connect_proxy, unset_statusbar_tooltip, set_statusbar_tooltip):
	Imported a few functions that handle menu tooltips and statusbars.

2005-05-28  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_copy_tooltip_from_stockid):
	Takes a stockid, and sends back a copy of a nice tooltip string.

2005-05-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Split the button setting routine out
	from the initialiser and give it its own function. This results in
	nicer code.
	Oops: make _set_message handle NULL strings properly.

2005-05-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Add a message area to the dialog. Use
	games_scores_dialog_set_message. Also add an extra option to _new
	to set the button types.

2005-05-04  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-card-pixmaps.c (games_card_pixmaps_get_red_joker): 
	Specify the correct card. This only affected Aisleriot Thieves.

2005-04-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Handle the case when no categories are
	defined. i.e. games with only one level.

2005-04-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-controls.c: Don't leak a gconf client reference when
	errors occur.

2005-04-04  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_items): i18n notes.

2005-04-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Port Dennis' UI fixes back to the gob
	fiile and repack the vbox so that it works as expected by
	same-gnome et. al.

2005-03-31  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_items): Remove ellipsis for the menuitem "Scores",
	since it does not require further input from the user prior to doing something. 
	Also, try using "New", "Pause" and "Restart" without appending the word "Game".

2005-03-30  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.h:
	* games-stock.c: New files to support games-stock menu items.
	Call games_stock_init () prior to using the items.

2005-03-23  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>
 
 	* gnome-scores-dialog.c: Make the scores dialog more HIG compliant.
 	
2005-03-23  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-gridframe.h:
	* games-gridframe.c: Alignment support added throughout.
	games_grid_frame_set_alignment): New function.

2005-03-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c: A patch from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to make the network game dialog a lot,
	lot, less ugly.

	* games-frame.c: 	
	* games-frame.h: A patch from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to convert games-frame to be what is
	essentially gimp-frame. This makes it a far nicer widget and lets
	the labels on vertically stacked frames align correctly..

2005-02-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Patch from Nickolay V. Shmyrev to get
	translation of the high-scores dialog working properly. See bug
	#167175.

2005-01-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-files.c: Remove duplicates from the returned lists. This
	includes removing duplicates after the names are transformed. If
	it were a general API I might be worried about this behaviour, but
	this is almost always what we want in our case.

2005-01-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Move the widgets in the vbox from the
	start to the end to make it easier to add a label at the
	beginning.

2005-01-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Creat a new widget for handling the
	display of scores. It is based on the scores dialog from
	gnomine (which has since been converted to use this).

2005-01-03  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_new_from_uri): Removed. 

2004-11-15  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* games-network-dialog.c:
	* games-gridframe.c:
	* games-gconf.c:
	* games-card-selector.c: Don't use gnome.h or bonobo-i18n.h.

	* games-preimage.[ch] (games_preimage_new_from_file):
	* games-card-images.c (games_card_images_prerender): API change so
	make it clear that we don't depend on gnome-vfs.

2004-12-16  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-controls.c: Disable list->view search.

2004-12-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-pixmaps.c: gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask -> 
	gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask_for_colormap.

2004-11-29  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-card-images.c:
	* games-card-pixmaps.c: In range checks, return NULL if fail.

2004-11-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-images.c:
	* games-card-pixmaps.c:	
	* games-card-pixamps.h: Remove the duplicate definition of
	GAMES_CARD_ID and add some range checks for a cardids and the
	like.

2004-11-21  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-card-images.h, games-card-pixmaps.h (GAMES_CARD_ID):
	Support for ace-high decks. (#158899, Harry Ray)

2004-11-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network.c: Fix conflicting extern and static
	declarations. Fixes bug #158624 (compilation on AIX).

2004-11-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.h: Move G_BEGIN_DECLS below #include glib.h
	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_render): scale pixbufs using
	GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR rather than GDK_INTERP_HYPER... Better overall
	image quality meant off-center tiled images with unclean edges.

2004-11-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: Fix closing tag.

2004-11-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* .cvsignore:	
	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: Make a shema for the keys that

	* Makefile.am: Include the libhowl flags.

	* games-network-dialog.c (config_cb): Make the local networking
	options insensitive if we don't have libhowl available.

	* games-network.c: Made support for libhowl optional at
	compile-time. Search for NO_HOWL for the details.	
	(games_start_server): Removed the altternative paths to
	games-server.py. They are only usefil for developers who are quite
	capable of setting PATH for themselves.

2004-10-04  Andreas Rsdal <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* Makefile.am: Install games-server in bin directory.
	* games-network-dialog.[c|h]: Implement GUI support for howl.
	* games-network.[c|h]: Implement howl support for discovering. 
	Implement support for starting the games-server.	
	* games-server.py: Allow python server to run without a
	standard-input.
	
2004-10-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-images.c: Revert Richard's last patch since it
	conflicts with his previous patch.

	Don't delete prerendered images on resize.

	strictly C compliant. See bug #153064.

2004-09-20  Andreas Rsdal <andrearo stud ntnu no>

	* games-network.c: Use callback functions to handle the function
	calls from the network layer to the game. Also add the
	function games_send_gamedata (), which makes the network
	code more generalized.
	* games-network-dialog.c: Use callback functions, and
	disable the "Connect" button when no game can be started.
	* games-server.py: Add support for gnibbles.

2004-09-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-gridframe.h:
	* games-gridframe.c: Add code to allow for a "padding" in the
	frame so you can have space to do things like, say, draw the
	bottom and right lines of a grid. Also finally implemented
	games_grid_frame_set to resize the grid.

2004-08-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* paris.svg: Added.

	* games-card-pixmaps.c (games_card_pixmaps_get_card_by_id):
	Tweaked the alpha bi-level threshold to make the cards look
	better. Not perfect, but in the absence of true alpha-blending
	fairly nice.

2004-07-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	keyvals. This is of course all automatic and "just works".

	widget.

2004-05-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	think I'm doing the dispose/finalize stuff wrong though.

2004-05-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-files.c: Fix warnings.

2004-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): How about we actually distribute
	games-card-commons.h ?

2004-05-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-images.c: Render individual cards on demand rather
	than all at once.

2004-05-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-files.c (games_file_list_create_widget): Handle the case
	where the provided default isn't in the list.
