	(update_menu_sensitivities): Make sure the pause button is
	disabled at the start of the game. Also factorise out clock_start
	to always set the game state properly when the clock is started
	(this introduces a new state, GAME_WAITING, which is the time when
	we have displayed the tiles but no actions have been taken).

2006-03-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* help/C/mahjongg.xml: Remove the doctable link, it was broken
	*and* being used inappropriately. Replaced with the

	(bug #308684).

2005-07-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* maps.c: Declare 'y1' et al static, workaround for built-in 'y1()'

2005-05-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.schemas.in: 
	* mahjongg.c: When an invalid tile is clicked, instead of
	complaining, just select the new tile instead. This means that the
	popup warning options and all the associated code can disappear,
	not to mention the warning dialog itself.

2004-11-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.map:	
	* maps.c: Move some of the hard-coded maps out to file (Four
	Bridges and The Ziggurat).

	* maps.h:
	* mahjongg.c:
	* mahjongg.h: Add code to load maps from a file.

	other than just "New Game".
	(stop_hints): New, new, improved, improved, fix.

2004-10-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (stop_hints): Set timeout_counter directly to
	HINT_BLINK_NUM rather than repeatedly calling hint_callback to
	increment it.

2004-10-30  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* mahjongg.c (stop_hints): Run down the hint timeout, called from
	callbacks for new, restart, shuffle, undo, redo, and pause.

2004-10-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Fix up the restart sensitivity and make sure that
	the redo command doesn't do a quick set insensitive/ set sensitive
	on the redo button.

	* help/C/mahjongg.xml: Update docs to reflect the lack of a seed.

	* mahjongg.c: Remove the seed, both the UI and all the internal
	mechanisms. Also removed the old "confirm_action" multiplexer in
	favour of individual callbacks now that we don't confirm actions.

2004-09-26  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* drawing.c (load_images): Unref the old tilepixbuf on theme change.

2004-08-26  callum  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* mahjongg.c: Be explicit about the game_over enumeration starting
	at 0, we make assumptions about this and while most modern
	compilers should be OK, I have a bug (#145543) which I think is a
	result of this assumption failing.

2004-08-24  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* drawing.c (configure_pixmaps): Recreate tile images only when 
	the tileset changed, or if tile size changed after window resize.

2004-08-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* maya.png:
	* default.png: Moved these themes to the gnome-games-extra-data
	package.

2004-06-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* postmodern.svg:
	* mahjongg.schemas.in: Use the upgraded postmodern.svg from 
	Richard Hoelscher and make it the default.

2004-06-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Replace the dialog warning you about the map change
	not taking effect until the next game with one that offers the
	chance of starting a new game immediately.

2004-06-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Remove the explicit shuffle controls and
	only offer shuffle if the player has run out of moves.
	The undo button is now also offered rather than an OK
	button that leaves an unplayable board. Fixes bug
	#139295.

	* solubility.c: Fix the shuffle routine so that the same 
	tiles are reused. Fixes bug #139294.

2004-06-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	ziggurat.

2004-04-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Use games_clock_add_seconds and
	games_clock_get_seconds instead of referencing internal variables.

2004-03-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/mahjongg.xml:

	you shuffle.

2004-03-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	there is no conflict between the symbols.

2004-03-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (about_callback): Updated the credits to credit all
	those who contributed for 2.6. I am grateful to Jim Evans for
	drawing this very unfortunate oversight to my attention.

2004-03-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/figures/*: Updated images.

2004-02-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	level. Also removed the separator from the settings menu, it is
	not needed on a two-item menu.	

2004-02-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Added the maya.png tileset from Gonzalo Odiard.

2004-02-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* mahjongg.c (new_game): Make scores work properly.

	* solubility.c (shuffle): Removed unused variables.
	(walk_tree): Make the random shuffle actually uniform. I really
	shouldn't have tried to write that from memory.

2004-02-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Just fixing spelling and grammar in comments.

2004-02-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

2004-02-11  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* mahjongg.c (bg_colour_callback): Set saving background color

	Hoelscher to clear the selection before shuffling. Bug #131199.

2004-01-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.schemas.in:
	* mahjongg.c: Added new layouts from Rexford Newbould and
	Krzysztof Foltman. Mark the layout names for translation and made
	them more "readable" (i.e. easy->Easy).

2004-01-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c (recreate_tile_images): Set the gc for gdk_draw_pixbuf
	to NULL. It was being used, inappropriately for clipping with bad
	results. Fixes bug #131905.

	* drawing.c: Keep the aspect ratio of the tiles constant. Patch
	from Jim Evins (see bug #131957).

2004-01-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (pixmap_DATA): Added new tile sets, smooth.png and
	postmodern.svg.

2004-01-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c (board_click): Ignore double click and triple click
	events, we were treating them as single click events and therefore
	were getting duplicates. Fixes bug #130856.

2003-12-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c:	
	* solubility.c (shuffle): Shuffling finally works properly. Rather
	than doing a permutation we re-use the pile-creation routine to
	create a new pile that is guaranteed to me solvable. Undo and redo
	are also properly set. The dependence of solubility.c on string.h
	has also been removed. This fixes bugs 91098 and 94750.

2003-12-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: 
	* solubility.c: Work on the new shuffle algorithm so that
	it produces solvable results (if possible).

2003-12-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c (draw_all_tiles): Fix a drawing error when shuffling
	the tiles.

	* mahjongg.c (check_free): Add a shuffle option to the "no more
	moves dialog".

2003-11-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: That reference to bg_DATA shouldn't have been
	there. Thanks Steve.

2003-10-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Removed *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

2003-10-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Change the way gconf files are
	installed. This should improve things for people building outside
	the source tree. See bug #123192.

2003-10-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/mahjongg.xml: Updated the documentation to reflect what
	has changed recently.

	* mahjongg.c: Just adding myself to the credits. 

2003-10-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>
	
	* mahjongg.c: 
	* drawing.c: Replace functions deprecated in gtk+ 2.4.

2003-10-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c: Fixed the problem with tiles on the second layer at
	the top of the screen not being drawn. gint + guint evaluates to
	guint in a comparison operation. Oops..

2003-10-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c:
	* drawing.h:
	* mahjongg.c (load_map): Split the geometry calculations so that
	the bits which are not window-size dependent are separate and only
	calculated once. Also made sure that the geometry is recalculated
	when the map changes.

	* drawing.c: Fixed the background colour problem.

2003-10-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c
	* mahjongg.schemas.in
	* mahjongg.h
	* mahjongg.c: Save and restore the window size. Also make
	auto-apply preferences work again.

2003-09-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* mahjongg.c:
	* mahjongg.h:
	* drawing.c:
	* drawing.h:
	* *.png:
	* mahjongg.schemas.in
	* gnome-canvas-pimage.*
	* default.svg: A brand-new drawing subsystem that supports
	rescaling and all that crap. It is faster by about a factor of
	five and takes up less memory. The old foreground/background
	system has been dumped in favour of a monolithic tileset. SVG
	graphics are also now supported (and preferred). All the old
	graphics are now obsolete and have been removed. There is a new
	version of the png based default theme. Unfortunately
	there is only one svg graphics set and it isn't very good. Also
	gnome-canvas-pimage.* has been removed and we have drawing.*
	instead.

Wed Aug 27 15:06:19 2003  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* mahjongg.c (bg_changed_cb): if you're going to add -ansi to
	CFLAGS, you need to use ansi-compatible comments.
	(tileset_changed_cb): Ditto

2003-08-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Optimisations. Thats 10k shaved off, which amounts
	to about, oh, 0.3% of its RSS.

2003-08-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c (walk_tree): Fixed a silly bug which meant that the
	last two tiles couldn't be removed. So much for the testing I
	thought I was doing.

2003-08-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: I have rewritten the generate game code yet
	again. It builds a tree of moves so that if it hits a dead-end it
	backtracks rather than starting over again as the last version
	did. Unfortunately some of the elegance has disappeared in the
	debugging stage.

2003-08-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Moved some code from generate_dependencies to
	generate_game so the later routine does not have to rely on the
	former having been run immediately beforehand. This means we can
	do a quick and dirty regeneration is the first one fails. Also
	added a loop to do just this. The algorithm is now correct,
	although probabilistic. The is also some accounting code in there
	to allow a bad generation to be detected. It's all a little messy
	right now, but not as bad as it was before this rewrite :).

2003-08-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.h:
        * solubility.c: Removed Michael Meeks old algorithm (sorry) and
	rewrote my new stuff with the new algorithm. See the head of the
	solubility.c file for details.
	
	* solubility.h:
	* solubility.c: 
	* mahjongg.c: Remap dependancies -> dependencies. We should have
	spelling mistakes in function names.

2003-08-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: GConf result checks and the like.

2003-08-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/mahjongg.xml: Updated for 2.4, including the graphics.

2003-07-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnome-canvas-pimage.c: Remove dead code, silence the compiler.

2003-07-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Fixed the clear_row_deps* functions so they
	actually work and give us a random, solvable, pile with the new
	code. Hints and end-of-game checks seem to be alright, but the
	new game button can produce unexpected results. Stick to the old
	code for now..

2003-07-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.desktop.in: Update name to fit HIG (bug 116916). 

2003-07-07  Steve Chaplin  <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Fix the high-score file
	installation (thanks Steve).

2003-06-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Moved the seed to the title bar to be consistent
	with other games (bug #114996). Also made the menu items
	(esp. undo redo) context sensitive. The menu and the toolbar now
	also match each other.

	* bg4.png: Darkened up the border when highlighted so that there
	is a distinct difference between selected and unselected.

2003-06-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: More work on the new code. Everything is
	theoretically in place, but naturally it doesn't work. However it
	does spell dependency correctly.

2003-06-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Started work on a cleaner new game routine. It is
	really only lacking in it's handling of the dependencies. The code
	is currently #ifdefed out.

	* mahjongg.c (update_score_state): It's that bloody memory leak
	again, in about the third app in a row.

2003-06-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (main): Doh, change the gconf key in the code too.

2003-06-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.schemas.in: Change the schema to be consistent and
	legal. 

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Remove bash specific shell
	code (for FreeBSD).

2003-06-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* mahjongg.c (properties_callback): Changed preferences dialog
	to 2x2 layout instead of 1x4.

2003-06-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Removed all the "are you sure" questions as well as
	the associated gconf key.

2003-06-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: UI consistency (see bug #114447).

2003-06-05  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Only install schemas
	if they are requested.

2003-05-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Implement setgid modifications
	(see gnome-games/ChangeLog). Also undo the score directory
	changes. It breaks more than it fixes.
	

2003-05-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (scoredir): Changed score directory to fix bug
	#113968.

2003-05-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (about_callback): Correct about dialog behaviour.

2003-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Made sure we can't have multiple score dialogs (bug
	#97320). Also removed the "want a new game" question.

2003-05-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: i18n fixups. Created the bold_frame convenience
	function to help achieve this. Fixes bug #112576. Also HIG fixups
	as per bug #112244.

2003-05-01  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	#84199).

2002-07-04  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* mahjongg.c: Created a new function gconf_sanity_check() which
	checks that a known key is valid. If this looks good, I'll add it
	to all of the GConf-based games. (yes, I am getting lots of bugs
	which end up as "the schemas are not installed")

2002-06-24  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	parent.

	  up the help doc okay, but we should change the call
	  to list Help with the pretty logo instead of just
	  listing 'mahjong'.  We also need to hook up a Help
	  button in the preferences dialog.  I have to run
	  now, so this will have to wait until later.

2000-09-13  Eric Baudais  <baudais@okstate.edu>

	* help/C/*: Added documentation to mahjongg.  It is not currently linked 
	into the program.

1998-11-19  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: Changing the map works now. Memory leaking is
	greatly reduced because images are destroyed after use. Changed
	gnome_dialog_set_modal (or whatever) to
	gtk_window_set_modal. Changing the tile images works
	too. Compiling warnings are gone. Most warnings during the game
	are gone too. Upped version to 0.99.1
	
1998-11-15  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: All the tile drawing is now done by
	gnome-canvas. The code is somewhat cleaner, and the redraws are
	definitely better. TODO: make changing map and changing tile
	images work. When you use gnome_canvas_item_set to change the
	image, do we need to destroy the old image? Version 0.99.0
	* default.png: Someone did something to the transparent parts of
	the image, so I put them again. This is to make tiles nicer.
	
1998-11-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* mahjongg.c: Calculate x and y offsets to place tiles in the
	center of the playfield (AREA_WIDTH x AREA_HEIGHT).  Calculate new 
	values every time the map changes.
