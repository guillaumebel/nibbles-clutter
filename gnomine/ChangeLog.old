	* face-*.svg: Use new tangoified faces from Lapo Calamandrei and
          Ulisse Perusin (Bug #400386)

2007-11-18  Robert Ancell  <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* minefield.c: Fix redraw error when holiding right and repeatedly clicking left
	  button. Adapted patch from WuSonghai in Bug #420643.
	* gnomine.c: Change from GConf to GamesConf (Bug #449505)

2007-06-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* minefield.c: Only redraw the necessary fields when clicking on
	a mine. Patch from Thomas Andersen in bug #375691. 

2007-04-25  Robert Ancell  <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* gnomine.c: Don't hide minefield if game not started (Bug #433036)

2006-12-10  Robert Ancell  <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* minefield.c: Refactored to add gtk_minefield_set_mark() (simpler to understand)
	* minefield.c: Added gtk_minefield_solve_square() (Bug #307245) (disabled by default)
	* gnomine.schemas.in: Added missing schema entries

2006-08-04  Andreas Røsdal  <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* help/C/gnomine.xml: Remove incorrect escaping of special
	character in XML documentation.

2006-10-01  Jason Clinton  <me@jasonclinton.com>

	* 16x16:
	* 22x22:
	* 32x32:
	* Makefile.am: Added 16, 22, and 32 icons sizes per Novell request

2006-08-21  Jason Clinton  <me@jasonclinton.com>

	* gnome-gnomines.png:
	* gnome-gnomines.svg:
	* Makefile.am: Added pixmap and SVG icons from Daniel Derozier <dcubed20@gmail.com>

2006-08-04  Andreas Røsdal  <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* minefield.c: Fix removal of prelight in top-left corner tile.
	Bug reported by Shaun McCance in Bug #349696. 


2006-07-14  Andreas Røsdal  <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* help/C/gnomine.xml:
	* gnomine.c: Add a Pause/Resume menu item. See Bug #346969.

        in Bug #346404.

2006-04-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Tweak the about info.

2006-04-06  Thomas Andersen  <phomes@gmail.com>

	* gnomine.c: Update About dialog

2006-04-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.desktop.in: 
	* Makefile.am: Update the icon handling to use icon themes.

2006-03-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c (main): Patch from Thomas Andersen to upgrade popt to
	GOption.

2006-02-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove the spurious dependence on gstreamer.

2006-01-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: (gpointer) cast -> GINT_TO_POINTER. This should fix
	bug #320713.

2006-01-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_multi_release): Remove a spurious
	warning.

2006-01-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Patch from Scott Bronson to ensure user-edited
	accelerators are saved (bug #327280).

2006-01-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c (win_game): Remove the scaling code for the custom
	scores. Due to a stuff-up on my part it hasn't actually been
	called for the entirety of the last release cycle. On top of that
	it makes for a UI nightmare (how do you explain the jump from a
	time to a score?). Given no-one has complained I think it is best
	that people realise that custom scores are just there to give some
	sort of metric and not something that should be competed over.

2006-01-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Patch to allow compilation with the Forte C
	compiler. (Damien Carbery, Bug #326024.)

2005-12-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c (main): Add setgid_io_init ().

2005-10-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_motion_notify): Don't reset c to -1
	when a button is release: other buttons may still be pressed. Also
	add a check on the value of c to _multi_release. See bug 315767.

2005-09-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Remove calls to the old games-scores-dialog API.

2005-09-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Migrate to the new high scores API.

2005-08-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* minefield.c: Decide what to do with a left-click when the button
	is released. This fixes a reversion in behaviour when "sweeping"
	the board. See bug #314403. As a side-effect the highlight of
	surrounding squares also behaves properly when sweeping from a
	cleared square to an uncleared one.

2005-08-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Added context tags as per the request in bug
	#312802. 

2005-07-20  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* gnomine/gnomine.c: Add a mnemonic to the new game button.

2005-07-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Do the inline thing properly. The glib docs are not
	just "vague", but actively misleading.

2005-07-11  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c: Make ui_description readonly.

2005-07-10  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c (show_scores): Set dialog style as ascending time (#309958)

2005-06-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Commented out some experimental sound code. It
	will be deleted later when I figure out how to play overlapping 
	copies of the same sound.

2005-06-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Make sure the New Game button actually starts a new
	game.

2005-05-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (show_scores): Use a message dialog for non top-ten
	games. Just like Same GNOME. Also hook up the quit button so it
	does the right thing.

2005-05-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Debrand: GNOME Mines -> Mines.
	(show_scores): First steps towards quit/new games actions on the
	end-of game high-scores dialog.

2005-05-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Create an unchecked version of cell_idx and make it
	inline. Use it where we call often and can guarantee the range.
	(gtk_minefield_set_size): Consolidate the size checking at the
	beginning.

2005-05-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Make sure that the correct level always appears in
	the scores dialog, even when we don't set a high score.

	* minefield.c: Refactoring the calls to gtk_minefield_win into
	gtk_minefield_check_field. Cleaned up the declarations and added
	some comments. "secs" has been removed. Removed all use of inline,
	we have no need of speed and it was adding 4% to the size of the
	binary (especially cell_idx which was called a lot). cell_idx was
	explicitly inlined in gtk_minefield_check_field (without the
	unnecessary range checks).

2005-05-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Cleaned up the button press code by adding an
	action field to the minefield structure that remembers what we are
	trying to do rather than trying to guess from button states. Also
	made left-clicking on a number the same as middle clicking. This
	is to make play even easier on a two-button mouse (i.e. my laptop).

2005-05-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* minefield.c:	
	* minefield.h: Draw an explosion over a mine when it blows up.

2005-05-11  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_setup_numbers): Remove the workaround
	for pango absolute font sizes. Specify "Sans" rather than "Mono 8"
	for the font family, since it seems like it wasn't a valid name
	anyway and "Mono" is uglier.

2005-04-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Make sure that the cell is drawn properly if the
	last move before winning the game was from a hint.

	* gnomine.c (fix_nmines): Adjust the maimum number of mines down 1
	so that we have at least one square for the player to reveal.

	* minefield.c: Fix all cases where the return value of cell_idx
	either wasn't being checked or was stored in an unsigned integer
	(and was then being checked for equality to -1!).	
	(gtk_minefield_hint): Case 3 was finding duplicates and could
	potentially overflow its memory allocation - make sure it doesn't
	do either.

2005-04-13  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c (main): Clean up the signal for focus out that was 
	connected twice by accident during the UI changeup. 

2005-03-31  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* glines.c (fullscreen_callback): Leave setting of the fullscreen
	actions visibility to the callback that handles window state events.

2005-03-30  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>

	* gnomine.c: Add fullscreen (Bug 172121)

2005-03-30  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c: Port to GtkUIInfo. Callback expecting a GtkWidget param
	rather than GtkAction now get neither. Uses games-stock menu items.
	Removed include of math.h, since we no longer use the rint() function.
	Many globlals have been moved to a more precise scope.
	"resume_container" and "resume_button" replace the names for widgets
	involving the button that appears when the game is paused.
	(scores_callback): Gratuitous renaming, was "top_ten".
	(about_callbak): Remove flawed i18n code, port to GtkAboutDialog.
	(show_face),(quit_game),(focus_out_cb),(resume_game_cb): UI updates.
	(new_game): Since *mfield is global, no need to pass it as a param.
	(main): Call games_stock_init().
	The status area, which same-gnome was modeled after, is now modeled
	after same gnome. (Specifically, gulf between label and data removed.)
	Make "Press to resume" comply with HIG (capitalized "Resume").

	Mark "Press to resume" for translation. (Bug #172027, Marco Colombo)

2005-03-13  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_randomize): Ensure that the first square
	and adjacent ones are mine free. Should drasticly reduce the occurence
	of dud games. Bug #170264
	* gnomine.c (fix_nmines, verify_ranges): Mine limit of squares minus 9

2005-03-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Patches from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to make the game more HIG compliant.

2005-02-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (show_scores): Bug 168270. Show the correct high score 
	category when we win a game.

2005-02-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_get_type): Fill out the GTypeInfo
	structure completely. This looks like what has been causing the
	start-up crashes.

2005-02-02  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c (create_preferences): Set mines spinbutton range here,
	as it only relied on x/ysize spinbutton cb. Remove harmless FIXME.

2005-01-10  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* minefield.c (_setup_sign) (gtk_minefield_setup_signs): 
	Provide warnings for image loading failure and missing images.

2005-01-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Use the generic games-scores-dialog rather than our
	custom one. Also make scores permanently sensitive so people can
	view the high score lists for the other sizes. Also cleanup some
	unnecessarily compilcated code to do with the scoring.

2005-01-03  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* minefield.c (_setup_sign): Preimage API update, uri -> file.

2004-11-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Fix the window placement check. && instead of
	||, it allows a negative placement. Also move to later so that the
	window->window dereference doesn't segfault. The cause of bug
	#150186 ? Possibly, but they don't mention session-management.
	
	Also changed some checks to avoid GTK warnings when things are set
	to negative values.

	Also replace home-brew range () with glib's CLAMP ().

2004-11-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Use gtk_window_set_default_icon_name (via
	Paolo Borelli).

2004-09-25  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* minefield.h
	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_init): switch to GamesPreimage.
	(_setup_sign): Replace gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple with
	games_preimage_render.
	
2004-09-06  callum  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c (show_face): Remove debugging code and make the face
	change again (Fixes bug 151931).

2004-08-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Remove the explicit call to
	gtk_widget_set_size_request for the face button. This clips the
	image badly. Fixes bug #144801.

2004-08-17  callum  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gnomine.c: Fix up the checking code for nmines so that we can't
	set nmines too high with gconf-editor.

2004-08-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (fill_score_list): Change the high score reporting to
	avoid a rounding error which could drop a second from the
	times. See bug #149549.

2004-07-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Fix memory leaks in the hint code (bug #146267).

2004-07-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* face*.xpm:
	* face*.png:	
	* gnomine.c: Replace the sort-of alpha blended faces with properly
	alpha-blended faces. Also move the focus border outside the
	button. This is all to try and improve the look of the face, see
	bug #144801.

2004-06-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c:
	* minefield.h: Draw the "wrong flag" cross in a scalable 
	manner.

2004-05-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (fill_score_list): Calculate times for the score 
	list correctly. The scores are not in hundredths of a second, 
	they are a decimal number of the form: minutes.seconds. Fixes
	bug #142716.

2004-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (show_scores): Further tweaks to the scores dialog.

2004-05-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Implemented the new scores dialog.

2004-04-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (about): Fix up the credits to include Richard's and
	Steve's contributions.

2004-03-06  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c:
	* minefield.c:	
	* minefield.h: Add a "hint_used" signal to the minefield widget so
	that we can adjust the score before a potential win. This is the
	fix for bug #136207 which does the least damage to the program
	model.

2004-03-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c: Explicitly use cell_idx rather than the explicit
	conversion functions. Added some warnings to try and pick up on
	#119043.

2004-03-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_mine_draw): Drawing fixes. A patch thanks to
	ed@catmur.co.uk (bug #135615). Also removed some redundant code.
	(gtk_minefield_multi_release): Fixed the long-standing "incorrect
	counts" bug (#103125), multi release wasn't checking whether the
	mines were shown or not.	
	(gtk_mine_draw): Solved a drawing problem where the cleared mines
	weren't being drawn if they were auto-cleared. The gorilla theme
	really higlighted this.
	(gtk_mine_draw): Add a warning to guard against a bug I suspect is
	still there.

2004-02-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_setup_numbers): Dynamically adjust
	the font size to take care of whatever scaling pango is using
	today. This is otherwise known as "an ugly hack".

2004-02-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (about): translator_credits ->
	translator-credits.

2004-02-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Adjusted the hint sensitivity patch again: make it
	work in the fresh-game situation. It's not very helpful, but it
	does make sense.

2004-02-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Minor changes to Richard's patch. Future-proofing
	(centralising the location of the hint array offset) and reducing
	the textural size of the if statement so that it visually matches
	it's importance in the routine. All in all, less than this
	explanation.

2004-02-07  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gnomine.c (focus_out_cb, resume_game_cb, show_face):
	Made the hint item insensitive when we're in "hide" mode, 
	when the game is over, and before a new game.

	* minefield.c (_setup_sign): Remove unused variable.
	(gtk_minefield_hint): Fixed hints in non-square minefields.

2004-01-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnome-gnomine.png: New graphic from Richard Hoelscher to fit in
	with the "nautical" theme we've decided on.

2004-01-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* minefield.c:
	* flag.svg:
	* mine.svg:
	* flag-question.svg:
	* flag.png:
	* mine.png:
	* flag-question.png: Replace the png graphics with SVG ones courtesy
	of Richard Hoelscher.

	* minefield.h:	
	* minefield.c: Moved over the using pixbufs for the flags and
	mines. This means a lot more client-server traffic until we cache
	the results in pixbufs. However the iamge quality improvement is
	immense.

2003-11-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Teaks to the main window to make it more
	aesthetically pleasing.

2003-11-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_toggle_mark): Removed an
	impossible-to-satisfy game-over check. Also limit the number of
	possible flags planted to be the same as the number of mines. This
	removes another odd-ball case where the player becomes confused
	(see bug #103125).
	
	* gnomine.c (main): Repackage the status bar to stop the
	"shuffling widgets" effect from the timer.

2003-10-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.am: Removed *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

2003-10-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Change the way gconf files are
	installed. This should improve things for people building outside
	the source tree. Also consolidated the score file list under a
	variable. See bug #123192.

2003-10-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_mine_draw): Convert the drawing functions to
	use gtk_paint_* more. Also made the cleared and uncleared cells
	use different GTK_STATEs to make them easier to distinguish (bug
	122969).

	* gnomine.c: Documented the undocumented command-line options.

2003-09-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Removed old i18n code that wasn't necessary
	and was crashing on Solaris.

2003-08-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_hint): Updated some comments, added a
	lymeric.

2003-08-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_hint): Complete rewrite to make the
	selection far more random.

2003-08-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_hint): Rewritten to be a 3-phase
	scheme. It uses Juhani Heino's code to first do a check for
	squares which are both near a mine *and* an uncleared square to
	try and give the player a bit of a hand when they are stuck with
	ambiguous hints. Unfortunately this highlights a failing with the
	previous algorithm where the location of the revealed tile is
	heavily influenced by the geometry of the revealed squares
	(e.g. the revealed square is highly likely to be at the bottom
	right of the revealed area.
	
2003-08-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c:
	* minefield.h:
	Take the random number generator out of _randomize and make it a
	property of the widget.
	
	* minefield.h:
	* gnomine.c: Added support for giving a hint. If possible a spot
	adjacent to a mine is cleared and a ten-second penalty is
	imposed. If not then a helpful (?) message is given. This was
	suggested by Juhani Heino <juhani.heino@1posti.net>.

2003-08-11  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gnomine.c:
	* minefield.c: Added license header comments.

	* gnomine.c (new_game): Make the game window stay the
	same size when the dimensions of the field change.

2003-08-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Make a little more compatible
	with automake-1.7.

2003-07-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_init): Made the assignments from
	Steve's patch slightly more explicit. This is just a matter of
	style and pedanticism.

2003-07-24  Steve Chaplin
	* minefield.h: Add a field to struct _Sign to hold a pixbuf.

	* minefield.c (_setup_sign): Check for error when reading pixbuf.
	Read each pixbuf from file just once, not at every expose event.
	(gtk_minefield_init): Initialise the pixbuf pointers,

2003-07-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.desktop.in (_Comment): Typo, see bug #117235.

2003-07-16  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_size_allocate): ANSI C build fix.

2003-07-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.desktop.in: Update name to fit HIG (bug 116916).

2003-07-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkmfframe.c: 
	* gtkmfframe.h:
	Removed since they are unnecessary.
	
	* gnomine.c (new_game): Add a conditional on the resizing code so
	the window is only resized if the grid size changes, this prevents
	unexpected window shrinkage when starting a new game and there was
	some space around the grid.

	* Makefile.am (gnomine_SOURCES): Removed the now unnecessary
	auxiliary widget files.

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_size_allocate): Let the minefield
	widget deal with the details of it's own size, the container only
	makes sure nothing stupid happens.

	* minefield.c (_setup_sign): Scale the pixmaps as per Jon's
	suggestion.

2003-07-07  Steve Chaplin  <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>

	* minefield.c (gtk_minefield_size_request): Make the size request for
	the minimum size, to allow the widget to be reduced in size.
	(gtk_minefield_init): Remove lines setting requisition width and height
	- this is the job of gtk_minefield_size_request().
	(gtk_minefield_setup_numbers): Call from gtk_minefield_expose () only,
	delete other calls to this function.
	Return immediately if the number size is already set correctly.
	(gtk_minefield_size_allocate): Accept the size allocation given, the
	frame widget that the minefield is inside will make sure its the 
	correct size.
	(gtk_minefield_set_mines): Deleted - minesize no longer needs to be 
	set and mcount can be set in one line of code.

	* minefield.h: Remove declaration of gtk_minefield_set_mines().
	Remove MINESIZE_MAX - the minesize is now dependant on the size of the 
	application window.

	* gnomine.c Add gconf keys for window width and height.
	Move MINESIZE_MIN, MINESIZE_MAX to minefield.h so that minefield.c
	can use them also. Increase MINESIZE_MIN from 2 to 12, I think it
	should probably go even larger.
	Remove KEY_MINESIZE, minesize is now set by sizing main window.
	(main): Comment out "configure_event".
	Read in window width and height from gconf and set default window size.
	Put the minefield inside the new frame widget.
	Remove the GtkAlignment that holds the vbox, its no longer required.
	(configure_cb): Remove function, not required any more.
	(quit_game): Save current window size to gconf.
	(new_game): Save the mine square size and use it to resize 
	the window after starting the new game.
	(setup_mode): Call from new_game() only, remove all other calls to 
	setup_mode().
	Substitute setup_mode() code into new_game() and delete setup_mode()
	(gconf_key_change_cb): Delete calls to gtk_minefield_set_size() and 
	gtk_minefield_set_mines() since they are both called now by new_game()
	Add range check for fsize.
	Remove KEY_MINESIZE section.
	(verify_ranges): Add range check for fsize. Remove minesize.
	(resume_game_cb): Show 'mf_frame' not 'mfield'.
	(focus_out_cb): Hide 'mf_frame' not 'mfield', simplify function.
	(create_preferences): Remove minesize spinbutton.
	(minesize_spin_cb): Delete, minesize is now controlled by resizing the 
	main window.

	* Makefile.am (gnomine_SOURCES): Update to use the two new files.

	* gtkmfframe.h: 
	* gtkmfframe.c: New files that define a widget derived from GtkFrame
	that resizes the minefield.

2003-07-05  Steve Chaplin  <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>
 
        * gnomine.c (nstr): Remove and substitute the one line of code
        directly into save_state().
        (save_state): Use g_free () instead of free ().
 
2003-07-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c (main): Reinstate window resizing now that the public
	release has been made.

2003-07-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	*. gnomine.c (main): Disabled window resizing for the 2.3.4 release
	because it doesn't quite work right (sorry Steve, didn't get the
	fixes done in time).

2003-06-29  Steve Chaplin   <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>
 
        * minefield.c (gtk_minefield_randomize): Replace the randomize
	routine with the glib randomize functions. 
	(gtk_minefield_restart): Remove the call to init_random(), clear
	the mines but do not set new mines, leave that to
	gtk_minefield_randomize().
	(init_random): Delete unused function.
	(get_random): Delete unused function.
	(gtk_minefield_draw): Move draw routines to gtk_minefield_expose()
	and remove the function. The draw method is now deprecated, the
	preferred solution is to call gtk_widget_queue_draw() and let
	gtk_<widget>_expose do the drawing.
	(gtk_minefield_lose): Replace gtk_minefield_draw() call with
	gtk_widget_queue_draw().

2003-06-24  Steve Chaplin   <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>

       * gnomine.c (create_preferences): New function to create preferences
       dialog, but not display it.
       (preferences_callback): Call create_preferences() to create the
       preferences dialog, if it does not already exist.
       (configure_cb): Allow user to manually increase the minesize. It uses
       the preferences spin button to keep the preferences minesize value
       in sync with the real minesize value.
       (main): Make main window resizable.
       (gconf_key_change_cb): Shrink the main window when the minefield
       reduces in size.
       (new_game): Uncommented gtk_widget_show(minefield) because if you
       are playing a game and open preferences - the "Press to resume" 
       button pops up. If you change the field size, the minefield remains
       hidden and is not displayed.
       (main): Shrink the main window to recover the space that ralign was usin
       before it was hidden.
 
2003-06-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Give the high score files the
	correct permissions.

	with the GTK source files.

	* gnomine.c (about): replace deprecated gdk_pixbuf_unref ();

2003-06-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gnomine.c: Fixed silly bug where the face didn't change. It
	helps to hid them all first.

	* gnomine.c:
	* gnomine.schemas.in: Fix up Stephen's patch since we don't use
	question marks anymore. Also default to disabled since I have
	never, ever, seen anyone use them.

	* minefield.h:
	* minefield.c:
	* gnomine.schemas.in

	background grid to increase contrast. Amusingly high-contrast was
	the worst case with the old line-style. See bug #97732. Thanks go
	to Feiyun Wang for suggesting the solution and to Jonathan
	Blandford who suggested using a stipple.
	(gtk_minefield_check_field): Applied the patch in bug #97524, a
	minor optimisation.

1998-05-17 Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi>

	* minefield.c: Marking two mines fast resulted as doubleclick and
	               didn't work right
	* minefield.c: Changed multi press behaviour so that it always
	               displays what squares are about to be pressed
	* minefield.c: Mine is now marked directly when button is pressed down
	* minefield.c: You can't win anymore by marking mines to all squares.
	               Also, you can win now when there's only left same
	               amount of unopened and unmarked mines like you don't
	               really have to mark any mines to win :)
	* minefield.c: The previous fix "multi show didn't work if pressed
	               over marked mine" wasn't actually good idea, removed..
	* minefield.c: Colors of mines 4-8 changed
	* minefield.c: Opened mines have now thin borders, I think this is
	               somewhat clearer :) and bigger fonts can be used.
	* minefield.c: Square presses follow now mouse.
	* gnomine.c: Because of above, I removed the "off release" option
	             since it didn't have anything to do anymore..
	* gnomine.c: Minefield sizes changed to same as other minesweepers
	             have

1998-05-10 Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi>

        * minefield.c: multi show didn't work if pressed over marked mine

                    square it was pressed in.

	* gnomine.c (main): Removed unused variable mfieldbox.
	* minefield.c: Changed the type of the secs variable to time_t, as

	               and that's why there were warnings from Gtk.
