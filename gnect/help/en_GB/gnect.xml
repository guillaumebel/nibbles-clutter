  <!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->

  <!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->


  <sect1 id="intro">

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><application>Four-in-a-Row</application> is a four-in-a-row game for the GNOME Project. The object of the game is to build a line of four of your marbles while trying to stop your opponent (human or computer) building a line of his or her own. A line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.</para>

    <para>To run <application>Four-in-a-Row</application>, select <guimenuitem>Four-in-a-Row</guimenuitem> from the <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>gnect</command> on the command line.</para>

    <para><application>Four-in-a-Row</application> is included in the gnome-games package, which is part of the GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version 2.8 of <application>Four-in-a-Row</application>.</para>

   <para>Four-in-a-Row also features <link linkend="network-games">multiplayer</link> support with two human players in hotseat or network mode.</para>

    <title>Basic Usage</title>

    <!-- ===== How to play ===== -->

    <sect2 id="playing">

      <title>Playing Four-in-a-Row</title>

      <para>To start a new game of Four-in-a-Row choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Game</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Game</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

      <para>The <interface>game board</interface> consists of seven columns and six rows. Above it, a special row indicates the current player and the marble about to be played. Each move consists of dropping a marble in one of the columns. The marble lands on the topmost empty row of the chosen column.</para>
        
      <para>To make a move, click on a column with the mouse. To play with the keyboard, move the marble in the top row with the left and right arrow keys, and drop it in place with the down arrow key. Your marble will drop into the topmost empty row of that column.</para>

      <!-- Figure -->
      <mediaobject id="mainwindow-fig">
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="figures/mainwindow.png" format="PNG" srccredit="trm"/>
        </imageobject>

        </textobject>
        <caption><para>Four-in-a-Row's Main Window</para></caption>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The game is won when one of the two players manages to line up four of his or her marbles horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If the board fills up without a win, the game ends in a draw.</para>

    </sect2>
    
    <!-- ===== Commands ===== -->  
    
    <sect2 id="commands">
      <title>Commands</title>
      <anchor id="menubar"/><!-- id for removed section -->
      
      <para>To take back a move, choose <menuchoice><shortcut><keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo></shortcut><guimenuitem>Undo move</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. If you're playing against a friend, this will undo one move. If you're playing against the computer, this will undo the computer's last move and then yours. Repeating this will return the board to its initial state.</para>
      <para>Choose <menuchoice><shortcut><keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keycap>H</keycap></keycombo></shortcut><guimenuitem>Hint</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to get a suggestion from the computer for your next move. This is shown in the status bar.</para>
      
      <para>Choose <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Scores</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to show a tally of wins and draws for the current playing session. The scores will be reset to zero if Player Selection is changed in Preferences.</para>      

      
    </sect2>  

    <!-- ===== Preferences ===== -->

    <sect2 id="prefsdialog">

      <title>Preferences</title>

      <para>To change the game's settings, select <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu. This opens the <interface>Preferences Dialogue</interface>.</para>

      <para>Configuration options in the <guilabel>Game</guilabel> tab are: <variablelist>

          <varlistentry>
            <term><guilabel>Player One</guilabel> and <guilabel>Player Two</guilabel></term>
            <listitem>
              <para>These two columns tell <application>Four-in-a-Row</application> who's playing and, if it is the computer, how well they play. To play against a friend, select <guilabel>Human for both Player One and Player Two</guilabel>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>

  <!-- ===== Custom Themes ===================================== -->


  <sect1 id="custom">

    <title>Creating New Themes</title>

    <para>This section is included in case you'd like to make your own themes for <application>Four-in-a-Row</application>. It assumes you're familiar with basic text editing, graphics software and the command line.</para>

    <sect2 id="images">

      <title>Images</title>

      <para><application>Four-in-a-Row</application>'s tile sets contain six tiles of equal size, lined up horizontally. From left to right:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Player One's marble as it appears on the game board</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Player Two's marble as it appears on the game board</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The game board's background</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The top row's background</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Player One's marble as it appears on the top row</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Player Two's marble as it appears on the top row</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <figure id="shot1">
        <title>An example tile set</title>
        <screenshot>
          <screeninfo>This image shows the six tiles in a tile set</screeninfo>
          <graphic format="PNG" fileref="figures/tileset.png" srccredit="TRM"/>
        </screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>Tiles three and four will be repeated over the game board and top row unless a full window background image is specified in the theme file.</para>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para>PNG format is recommended for tile sets. The first, second, fifth and sixth tiles should contain some transparency if you want the background to show through. The third and fourth tiles should be solid, with no transparency, even if you'll be using a full window background image with your theme.</para>
      </tip>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para>Tiles can be square or rectangular, and any size you like. Most of the tile sets that come with <application>Four-in-a-Row</application> use square tiles measuring 50 pixels by 50 pixels.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>For a full window background image, there's a bit more work to do. Let's say your tiles measure 50 by 50 pixels each. The game's display measures 7 by 7 tiles, including the top row, so the ideal background image for your tile set measures 350 by 350 pixels.</para>

      <tip>
        <title>TIP</title>
        <para><application>Four-in-a-Row</application> will automatically scale the background image if it doesn't match the tile set. This means you can make "large" and "small" versions of your theme, both using the same background image, just by having a large and a small version of your tile set.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>So, you now have a tile set and perhaps a background image to go with it. The next step is to put them in the right place.</para>

    </sect2>


    <sect2 id="directories">

      <title>Putting It Together</title>

      <para>The last step is to put your image or images where <application>Four-in-a-Row</application> can find them. You could put them in <application>Four-in-a-Row</application>'s install directory (which will depend on your particular system), but your home directory is probably a better idea.</para>

      <para>Make a <filename class="directory">~/.gnect</filename> directory, and a <filename class="directory">~/.gnect/pixmaps</filename> directory. Those names are important, as <application>Four-in-a-Row</application> won't look anywhere else.</para>

      <para>Copy your image(s) into the pixmaps directory.</para>

      <para>If you start <application>Four-in-a-Row</application> from the command line, it'll give you clues about any problems it has with your new theme. If it has none, you'll find your new theme listed the <interface>Preferences Dialogue</interface>.</para>

      <para>Have fun!</para>
