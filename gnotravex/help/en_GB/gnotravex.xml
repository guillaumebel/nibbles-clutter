The right hand side contains a box containing the pieces you have yet to place and the left-hand box is where you arrange the pieces.</para>

     <para>The tiles are divided into four and you must position them so that only two numbers that are the same are next to each other. The game wil not let you position the tiles so that different numbers are next to each other. You position the pieces by dragging them from their current position, either in the right-hand box or the main box, to their new position. These moves are not permanent and can be readily reversed. You may also move all the pieces in the left-hand box at once by using the commands: <menuchoice><guimenu>Move</guimenu><guimenuitem>Left/Right/Up/Down</guimenuitem></menuchoice></para>

     <para>The game is completed when you have positioned all the squares in the right positions. When you have completed the game you are shown your ranking in the high scores table, if you get a high enough score. If you have used either Hint or Solve your score will not be included in the high scores table.</para>
