2006-04-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* ui.c:
	* same-gnome.desktop.in: Update the icon handling to use icon
	themes. Rename gnome-gsame.png gnome-same-gnome.png.

2006-03-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* same-gnome.c (initialise_options): Make sure that the -z option
	doesn't get over-ridden by the auto-save game and also make it use
	the logical numbering (i.e. SMALL=1, not 2).

	* same-gnome.c: Patch from Paolo Borelli to use GOption. See bug
	#336095.

2006-03-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	errors.

2005-08-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c (expose_cb): Avoid drawing glitches when expose is
	called during an animation. Also remove the redraw_cb and call
	redraw explicitly at the end of the render. The effect is far 
	better and makes de-glitching easier. Also fix the multiple 
	calls to set up the render callback.

	* same-gnome.h: 
	* same-gnome.c:
	* game.h:
	* game.c:
	* ui.c: Patch from Tom Rathbone to save the game state between

	* game.h: 
	* same-gnome.c: 
	* input.c: 
	* game.c: 
	* drawing.c: Rearrange include files to try and avoid a

	actually use.

2005-06-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* ui.c: Patch from Paolo Borelli to fix some memory leaks and
	sprinkle a few "const" statements around.

	be done in a just-in-time fashion.

	better) colour and make it two pixels wide. Also draw the top and
	bottom lines in the cirrect place.
	
2005-04-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* drawing.c: Preliminary support for non black and white
	background and grid. The colours are still awful though.

2005-04-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* ui.c: 
	* ui.h:
	* game.c: Remove the ball count message and just use the points
	message. This solves the criticism in bug #172359 via a different
	route.
	
	* help/C/same-gnome.xml: 
	* drawing.h: 
	* same-gnome.h: 
	* ui.c:

2005-03-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/same-gnome.xml: Yet more updates. I actually
	spell-checked it this time. Also fixed up one of the pictures, I
	have no idea how a lime green line got down one side of it.
